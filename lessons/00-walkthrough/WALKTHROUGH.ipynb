    "## What is Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks is a web-based interactive programming Environment which mixes code and text. The basic unit of a notebook is the **cell.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Click in the cell below. You will see the cell is **highlighted in green**. Since this cell is selected, it should say **Code** in the toolbar (Underneath Navigate in the menu).\n",
    "\n",
    "Press the `>| Run` button to execute the code.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "code",
   "execution_count": null,
   "metadata": {},
   "outputs": [],
   "source": [
    "print(\"Hi There!\")\n",
    "print(\"This is a cell.\")"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "You should see the program's output underneath the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice when the Cell runs it places a number in brackets for example`In [1]`. This in an indication that the cell was run. The number increments each time a cell is run in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's run it again\n",
    "\n",
    "To **Edit** the cell you must click on it again to select it. \n",
    "\n",
    "**DO THIS:** Edit the cell above so that it says `print(\"Hi Mike!\")` instead of `print(\"Hi There!\")`. When you finish your edit, run the cell again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### These Cells are all connected within the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the cells in the same notebook share one Python environment. So what happens in one cell, if saved to a variable will be accessible in another cell. For example, the first cell below stores the value `\"Python\"` in memory under the name `x`. The next cell prints the value of `x`. \n",
    "\n",

    "1. Once you have your SU Google account, visit https://okpy.org and click the **Student Login** button.\n",
